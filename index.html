                <p>Valorants closed beta launched and was availible through twitch drops. The game was in a very early stage compared to now, only half the agents and maps and graphics were very different.</p>
                <details>
                twich drops are a way of rewarding the community through viewtime with rewards<br>
                At this point in release Valorant was in a very early stage, where graphics, agents and abilities, all the way to skins were very different. <br>
                During the beta skins were open to purchase but they were not going to be availible on the full release of the game.<br>
                The games UI was also very different and ranking system was down a rank compared to now with the highest rank being named "valorant".
